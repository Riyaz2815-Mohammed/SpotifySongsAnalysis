🎵 Spotify Songs Analysis
📌 Overview

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Spotify songs to understand patterns in musical attributes and listener preferences. Using a real-world dataset, the analysis examines how features like energy, danceability, tempo, loudness, and popularity vary across tracks and genres.

The goal of this project is to practice data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Python and to extract meaningful insights from raw data.
